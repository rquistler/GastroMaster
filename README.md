Our app help waitresses to take orders from a customer.
Normally a waitress notes the orders on a piece of paper.
That is fast but you have to add you orders to a system to manage all
order and you have to transfer the order to the kitchen. There is the
risk that a piece of paper get lost in the kitchen. That cannot happen
when the whole order process is digital. That saves you a lot of time
and prevent human mistakes while business.
