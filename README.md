# Gastro Master

### [**MANUAL**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvAAOebav86d2c6mhpUur8YLNJSuMkPx4NxIZjK-1hc/edit?usp=sharing)

Our app help waitresses to take orders from a customer.
Normally a waitress notes the orders on a piece of paper.
That is fast but you have to add you orders to a system to manage all
order and you have to transfer the order to the kitchen. There is the
risk that a piece of paper get lost in the kitchen. That cannot happen
when the whole order process is digital. That saves you a lot of time
and prevent human mistakes while business.
